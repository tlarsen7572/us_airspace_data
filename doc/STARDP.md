## Standard terminal arrivals (STAR) and standard departure procedures (DP)

STARs are pre-defined IFR routes for arriving traffic. STARs simplify the clearance delivery process and provide a standard way to transition from en-route navigation to instrument approaches.

DPs are the opposite of STARs: pre-defined IFR routes for departing traffic. DPs also simplify clearance delivery procedures and provide a standard way for departing traffic to transition to en-route navigation.

Both types of procedures share a common data structure and are defined in the same 2 tables.
