## Air Route Traffic Control Center (ARTCC) facilities and communications

ARTCCs (often called 'centers') are air traffic control facilities providing control services to aircraft on Instrument Flight Rules (IFR) flight plans. ARTCCs provide control services for the enroute portion of a flight. After an aircraft leaves the airspace of the departure airport, control services will be handed off to a center until the aircraft nears the arrival airport.
