## Air traffic service route airways

Air Traffic Service (ATS) routes are specified routes designed to channel air traffic as needed for the provisioning of air traffic services.

There are 4 tables defining ATS routes:

|Table        |Description|
|-------------|-----------|
|ATS1         |Defines each segment of the ATS route|
|ATS2         |Defines points in the ATS route|
|ATS4         |Remarks about points in ATS routes|
|ATS-RMK      |Remarks about entire ATS routes rather than specific points|
