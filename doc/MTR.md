## Military training routes

Military Training Routes (MTR) are low-altitude, high-speed corridors used for military training purposes. While the normal speed limit below 10,000 ft MSL is 250 knots, within MTRs military pilots are allowed to exceed this limit. Given the difficulty of seeing and avoiding aircraft operating at such high speeds, MTRs are published to alert civilian pilots of these operations.

MTRs are defined using several tables.

|Table        |Description|
|-------------|-----------|
|MTR1         |Route master|
|MTR1-ARTCC   |The ARTCCs through which the route operates|
|MTR1-FSS     |All Flight Service Stations within 150 nautical miles of the route|
|MTR2         |Special operating procedures|
|MTR3         |Route dimensions|
|MTR4         |Terrain following operations|
|MTR5         |Each point of the route, in sequence|
|MTR6         |Agency information|
