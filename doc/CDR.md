## Coded departure routes

Coded Departure Routes (CDR) are pre-defined routes between two landing facilities. They provide an easy alternative when factors such as thunderstorms and excessive traffic require a change from the original flight plan.

CDRs are stored in the CDR table. Each record is a different route. The points of the route are in the Route field as a space-delimited list of waypoints.
