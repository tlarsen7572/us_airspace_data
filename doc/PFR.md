## Preferred routes

Preferred Routes (PFR) are pre-defined IFR routes between two airports. These routes are designed to expeditiously move large volumes of traffic by reducing coordination needs.

PFRs are defined in 2 tables.

|Table  |Description|
|-------|-----------|
|PFR1   |Basic route information, including origination and destination|
|PFR2   |A segment of a PFR, which can be a discrete point such as a FIX or NAVAID or a series of points along an airway|
