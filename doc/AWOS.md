## Automated weather/surface observing systems

AWOS (Automated Weather Observing System) and ASOS (Automated Surface Observing System) are both types of automated weather reporting stations. AWOS tend to be operated by the FAA and produce minute-by-minute reports. ASOS tend to be operated by the National Weather Service and Department of Defense and produce hourly reports.

AWOS/ASOS are defined by 2 tables.
