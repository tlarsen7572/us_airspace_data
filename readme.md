### National Airspace System Resource (NASR) data

This project's goal is to provide NASR data files in an open and user-friendly format. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) provides NASR files on 28-day and 56-day cycles. These data files contain a wealth of information about the airspace of the USA, from airport and runway information to navigational aids and weather stations. The files are provided by the FAA in flat-formatted text and XML files. This project parses these files and uploads them into a publicly-accessible PostgreSQL database.

This project is not affiliated or endorsed by the FAA or any department of the US government. It is purely a hobbyist-supported project and should not be used for production systems. It is intended as an educational resource for those who have an interest in both aviation and data analysis.
